TorchComposer is an open-source project that facilitates the creation and composition of neural networks using PyTorch.

## Description

TorchComposer offers an intuitive interface and a visual tool for designing and training complex neural networks. This project is aimed at developers and machine learning enthusiasts who wish to explore and experiment with neural networks without having to write PyTorch code from scratch.

## Key Features

- **Intuitive Graphical Interface:** Use an intuitive user interface to design and configure neural networks.
- **Visual Composition:** Compose your neural networks visually, connecting layers and defining their parameters.
- **Integrated Training:** Train directly within the TorchComposer environment and monitor performance metrics.
- **Export and Import:** Export the neural networks created in TorchComposer and import them into existing PyTorch projects.
- **Extensive Support:** Support for a wide range of neural network architectures and types.
